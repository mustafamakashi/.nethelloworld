# Samples-dotnet-helloworld
This is a simple Hello World example to show a .NET connection to InterSystems IRIS. It retrieves and outputs sample petstore data that has been preloaded into your instance of InterSystems IRIS.


## Run the sample
In the integrated terminal window type: 

* `cd /home/project/Samples-dotnet-helloworld`  
* `dotnet run`

	
This outputs data about the first five birds stored within InterSystems IRIS.

* Or continue to work with the preloaded petstore data.
